# Searchstring generator for Pokemon Go

This script generates a Searchstring based on your  [Pokedextracker](https://pokedextracker.com/) info. 

The basic idea is, that you can keep a list of caught/uncaugt Pokemon on Pokedextracker and then use that list in order to generate a Searchstring, which can be copied into Pokemon Go in order to instantly see which pokemon you need from each other.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

#### Python 3.7

> Should work with other versions, but has not been tested.

```powershell
choco install python
```

#### lxml

```powershell
pip install lxml
```

#### selenium

```powershell
pip install selenium
```

#### GoogleChrome

> can also work with other broweser but requires tweaking.

```powershell
choco install googlechrome
```

#### ChromeDriver

Download the ChromeDriver binary for your platform under the [downloads](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) section of this site.

The exe must be added to your `%PATH%` variable.

It may be possible tho install chromedriver with chocolatey, but it has not beent tested.

```powershell
choco install chromedriver
```
### Installing

Clone the project

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Gi0m/searchstring 
```

Change into the repo

```powershell
cd searchstring
```

Edit the `url` variable in `searchstring.py` to your pokedex with the text editor of your liking or run the script with the default/demo user.

You can also edit the `latestPkmn` variable if you wish to limit add newer generations or remove them.

To run the script in terminal simply type:

```powershell
python searchstring.py
```

The default pokedex then outputs the list of uncaught pokemon.

```
Fetching your list of uncaught pokemon
